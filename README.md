## 📘 About This Repository

This repo documents my **learning journey as a developer**, including exercises from university, CS50, self-study, and practice projects.  
It serves as a sandbox to solidify fundamentals before applying them in real-world automation and AI projects (such as **StrixFy**).

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`cs50_foundations/`](./cs50_foundations) | Harvard CS50 problem sets — C language, pointers, memory, data structures, and algorithms. |
| [`algorithms/`](./algorithms) | Practice with sorting, recursion, complexity, problem-solving, and competitive-programming-style exercises. |
| [`databases/`](./databases) | SQL exercises (MySQL / PostgreSQL) — relational modeling, joins, constraints, CRUD, stored procedures. |
| [`web_development/`](./web_development) | Front-end and back-end college exercises — HTML, CSS, JS, and small full-stack prototypes. |

✅ New folders will be added as I study new topics (OS, networking, Rust, automation, etc.)
